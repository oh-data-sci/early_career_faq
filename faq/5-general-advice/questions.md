# What’s one thing you wish you’d known when starting your own career in data?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- start networking early. it's like putting away savings. the benefits compound over time like compounding interests.
- in an organisational hierarchy, upwards communication, downwards communication, and peer communication are separate skills. don't be fooled that being good at one of them means you are good the others.
- skill and brilliance may get you hired, but don't reliably get you promoted. only strategic impact does. that may or may not require skill.
- think hard about what aspects of the role you enjoy the most. be aware of it if/when that shifts.

# For international students, what extra steps can help strengthen their chances in the UK job market?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- as an immigrant here myself, i am not aware of anything i did differently from native applicants. however, i may not be the best placed person to answer that. i am aware that i enjoy many unearned privileges for looking pretty much like the natives.
- you will need to network all the more hard though. you (probably) don't have a school mate from childhood, or an uncle or an acquaintance of your mother's in a bank in london looking to hire. but native brits do. to compete against that you will have to find and utilise whatever connections you make.

# For students who feel overwhelmed by how broad the data field is, what’s your advice for finding a focus or specialism?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- start with the part you most enjoy currently the part you are most interested in. at the edges of that aspect you will find in order to know better your favourite aspect you need to better understand another aspect. the more you know about a new aspect. you can start enjoying working with data, and expanding your skill base will feel much less
