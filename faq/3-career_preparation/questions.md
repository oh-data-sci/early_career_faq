# What makes a strong CV or LinkedIn profile for data-related positions?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- length (lack of it) and focus
- the link to your github repos, blog, your work examples

# What kinds of projects or portfolio work tend to impress recruiters most?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- those that are technically closest to the role being hired for. (being close to the subject area can also help, but being technically close is better. )
- e.g.: if the role is for time series analysis in the retail space and your project shows experience doing a time series analysis experience in healthcare, that's great. good but less great if you show clustering experience in retail. 
- note that most *recruiters* have never worked in data and their image of the roles normally differ widely from the actual role. that's to be expected. i don't really know what working as a recruiter is really like. so the answer is different for recruiters than it is for *hiring managers*.

# What’s the best way for students to network and find opportunities in the data industry?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- who planted this question?! the answer is obvious. go to the local meetup scene. i recommend the [brighton data forum ](https://www.meetup.com/brighton-data-forum)

# How do employers typically assess candidates in interviews for data roles, are there case studies, coding tasks, or presentation elements?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- all of the above. although at the junior level the decision is generally made in fewer interviewing rounds, unless the company is that much smaller. first interview: people team screen candidates for cv keywords, work permit, salary expectations, etc. second interview: technical test of some kind (varies). third interview: culture fit (just means: how is it going to be to have to work with you? how will you react to being forced to work with us? if there is a fourth interview it will be with someone higher up who has veto power, usually goes well). 

# Do you think internships or placements are essential, or can independent or university projects demonstrate readiness effectively?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- no, not essential. the technical aptitude and similarity between project work and the role description matters more.
