# What technical skills are most in demand for graduates entering the data job market today?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- number 1: sql and python. 
- secondary: software development best practices (version control, devops, automated testing, autmated documentation. 
- specialty system skills: R, sparks, business intelligence suite, 
- design thinking (as a product person)
# How important are communication and storytelling skills compared to purely technical abilities?
## A1. oskar holm, senior data scientist
- medium important for your project works (have something to say before you say it), and very important for your career. communication skills will affect your career progression a lot more than mathematical/programming skill.
# For students without industry experience, what’s the best way to gain practical, real-world exposure to data projects?
	- outside of actually getting hired, i don't really know. but here are some thinking out loud ideas:
	- find someone who will take you: use your contacts, see if anybody has an analytical challenge on their hands to help. you are unlikely to get their data, but you can show that you know how to handle data like theirs to solve a problem like theirs. solve it, using synthetic data if you must. put it on github. write a blog. 
	- go at it alone: take a skill you are already good at (e.g. time series analysis) and apply it to a problem in a space you are already knowledgeable about (football? f1 racing? astronomy?)  tackle it. put it on github. write a blog.
# Are online certifications valuable for employability?
	- a) not for you, as you will already have a degree from an accredited institute and that trumps any online certificate (unless the latter is on precisely the topic the role is about). the problem is knowing what an online certificate actually tells a potential employer. it will have to be a certificate from someplace that the hiring managed knows of. i have had candidates put certificates on their cvs, and i have no idea what they are. they might demonstrate very impressive rigorous coursework, or they might be completely fraudulent. i am not investing my time researching online courses. 
	- b) yes. sometimes. especially in older, established and more conservative organisations: banks, govern ment. younger startups are more likely to look at your github repos and blog posts. 
# From your experience, what are the most common skills gaps you see in new graduates entering data roles?
	- SQL
	- working processes (note taking, documenting, testing, thoroughness, agile (tickets, work organisation)
